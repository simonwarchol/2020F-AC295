Mitt Romney of Utah on Tuesday issued a strong rebuke of the current tone of American politics saying they have become \"a vile, vituperative, hate-filled morass\" and roundly criticizing President Donald Trump for several of his recent comments which included insulting Democratic vice presidential nominee Kamala Harris. \"I\\'m troubled by our politics, as it has moved away from spirited debate to a vile, vituperative, hate-filled morass that is unbecoming of any free nation -- let alone the birthplace of modern democracy,\" Romney, the 2012 Republican presidential nominee, wrote in a statement in which he also called out Democrats for their own behavior and rhetoric. \"The President calls the Democratic vice presidential candidate \\'a monster;\\' he repeatedly labels the speaker of the house \\'crazy;\\' he calls for the Justice Department to put the prior president in jail; he attacks the governor of Michigan on the very day a plot is discovered to kidnap her,\" the statement read.  Romney also went on to criticize what he saw as unacceptable behavior from Democrats, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi\\'s decision to rip up Trump\\'s State of the Union address earlier this year and sports commentator Keith Olbermann\\'s recent attack on Republicans in which he referred to the President as a \"terrorist\" during his YouTube show. Olbermann, who recently left ESPN, also said Trump \"can be, and must be, expunged\" for \"the hate he has triggered.\" He noted that although Democrats have launched their own attacks, Joe Biden, the party\\'s presidential nominee, \"refuses to stoop as low as others.\" Romney has not endorsed a candidate for president and said in his statement he has \"stayed quiet with the approach of the election.\" The comments from Romney, a frequent Trump critic who himself has been attacked by the President in recent months, come amid a hyperpartisan political environment that will likely reach new heights next month following one of the most contentious elections in American history.  The Utah senator urged both parties to \"lower the heat\" in his statement, arguing that leaders \"must tone it down.\"  \"The consequence of the crescendo of anger leads to a very bad place. No sane person can want that,\" Romney wrote.

Earlier this year, CBP, which oversees border wall construction, said it was testing the black coating along some sections of the US-Mexico border in an effort to assess the operational benefits. That could extend to 82 miles in the Rio Grande Valley and Laredo, Texas. Agency officials told CNN the epoxy coating is an option for when future barriers are built. \"We\\'ve got existing contracts with the option in the contract to paint,\" a CBP official said. The reason behind the black finish, officials argued, is in part to provide a contrast against the natural surroundings.  It could cost an extra $1 million per mile, the agency said. During an Oval Office meeting last year, Trump told various government officials that he wanted the wall to be painted black and to include French-style doors.  CBP officials, who were not authorized to speak on the record, maintained the idea of painting barriers is not new. They also considered using white, but found that it could blend in with its surroundings. \"This isn\\'t new conversation about paint or coating. We\\'ve had that over the years,\" a CBP official said. \"It\\'s hard to say that that rust and the black changes that much, but it does because there\\'s just nothing natural out there that\\'s painted that black.\"  But current and former agency officials argue the painted finish would have little effectiveness, saying it\\'s largely being done to placate the President. \"Any technical, structural or engineering enhancement that paint provides is extremely limited,\" a US official said, adding that it will cost more in the long run to reapply paint as it wears. \"The stated reasons for painting the wall black changed so much, the only thing that hasn\\'t change is the President\\'s desire to paint it black,\" a former Homeland Security official told CNN.   Acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf previously said that the administration was assessing whether to paint the border wall in an effort to extend its lifespan. \"How do we get a longer lifespan out of the wall? And if that means, if we can paint it and it prolongs the life then we\\'ll do just that,\" he told reporters in Tucson, Arizona, in May. The administration is quickly pressing forward with its stated goal to build 450 miles by the end of this year, the majority of which replaces old, dilapidated wall, with a new enhanced wall system. CBP officials said they\\'re on pace to reach that goal, building between 10 to 12 miles a week.  The southern border wall has been a cornerstone of Trump\\'s presidency. Over the last three years, Trump has stirred controversy in his attempts to dip into military money for wall construction after Congress refused to provide the requested funds, floated ideas on the wall\\'s appearance and function that surprised officials, and regularly cited the ongoing construction as an achievement. \"My administration has done more than any administration in the history to secure our southern border. Our border has never been more secure,\" Trump said in June during a visit to the wall. Since January 2017, around $15 billion has been identified to construct roughly 738 miles of new border wall system using Homeland Security, Defense and Treasury Forfeiture Fund money. That includes miles that have been constructed, those still under construction, and miles in the pre-construction phase, according to CBP. To achieve the 450 mile mark, however, the President has taken unprecedented steps to shore up funds, including last year\\'s national emergency declaration. His administration has also waived numerous environmental and contracting laws to speed up construction. In February 2019, Trump declared a national emergency in order to secure funding to build his signature wall. The move paved the way for Trump to unlock billions of dollars in federal funds to construct additional barriers on the southern border, bypassing Congress after lawmakers refused to meet his multi-billion-dollar funding request. This year, the White House renewed the emergency despite a drop in illegal border crossings. The myriad ways the administration has sought to obtain funds has fueled lawsuits nationwide from states, environmental groups and border communities. At the core of the lawsuits is the accusation that the Trump administration circumvented Congress to obtain money for the wall.  ', 'House Democrats unveil package of reforms aimed at Trump  (CNN)House Democrats announced a package of government reforms Wednesday aimed at curbing actions taken by President Donald Trump, in an effort to address what they charge are some of the President\\'s most egregious abuses. The new legislation has virtually zero chance of becoming law this year, but it\\'s a wish list of policy changes related to everything from government spending at Trump\\'s properties to the President\\'s targeting of whistleblowers and firing of inspectors general. The legislative proposals are a roadmap for what Democrats may do next year if former Vice President Joe Biden wins the White House. At a news conference Wednesday, House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff said the package is intended \"to restore checks and balances, to protect our elections, and to protect the legacy of our founders.\" The legislation is a sweeping package of reforms Democrats want to make in response to Trump. The legislation would require the Justice Department and White House to provide information on pardons issued in cases involving the President, would suspend the statute of limitations on crimes for a sitting president, would update the Emoluments Clause and would strengthen Congress\\' power to subpoena the executive branch and prevent the administration from diverting funds appropriated by the Legislative Branch. It would add protections to inspectors general and federal whistleblowers and strengthen penalties under the Hatch Act, which is intended to prevent government officials from engaging in political activity. It also would require campaigns to report foreign offers of campaign help, another item Democrats have pushed in response to Trump campaign contacts with Russians. Schiff, a Democrat from California who spearheaded the House impeachment inquiry against Trump, acknowledged the legislation is unlikely to pass this year, but he voiced optimism that the proposal could gain Republican allies going forward. \"I think these reforms will have bipartisan support next year, in a new administration, when my GOP colleagues will not want to see a Democratic president do half the things of the current president,\" Schiff said. \"So, while I don\\'t expect to see GOP support in the Senate this year, I do expect these reforms will enjoy bipartisan support in the future.\" The legislation was offered by seven Democratic committee chairs, and many of the proposals included in the bill have been previously introduced on their own. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said the plan is \"future-focused\" and that it would help \"repair and strengthen our democracy.\" \"During this once in a generation moment, the Congress has a sacred obligation for the people to defend the rule of law and restore accountability and basic ethics to the government,\" she added.

The US cases piled up Thursday, surpassing China and Italy. The per capita rate of cases varies because of the countries' vast differences in population.  As of Thursday evening, the United States had at least 82,100 cases while China was reporting 81,782. There have been more than 510,000 cases reported worldwide. The countries' numbers are changing constantly and both the totals and the rank order of countries could change at any time. The grim milestone comes just as US officials said there was a new high for fatalities reported in a single day. At least 246 new deaths were reported Thursday, bringing the total number of deaths nationwide to at least 1,195. The spike of cases has hospitals around the country scrambling to keep up with the demand for care. In New York, where more than half of the US cases have been reported, exhausted hospital workers are turning to increasingly desperate measures to combat the virus. New York Bellevue Hospital Center created a makeshift morgue using tents and refrigerated trucks. At Elmhurst Hospital Center in Queens, 13 patients died from coronavirus within 24 hours. A registered nurse described what she has experienced inside a Long Island hospital and the toll that caring for coronavirus patients is taking on health care workers. \"I haven't slept because my mind won't shut off. I cried in the bathroom on my break, as I peeled off the PPE from my sweaty self, mask indentations on my face. I cried the entire ride home,\" the nurse wrote in a social media post. The nurse, whom CNN is not naming, says patients are streaming in with \"non stop coughing, sweaty, fevers\" and with \"fear in their eyes.\" \"I cry for the ones who passed away. I cry because we intubated 5 patients within 10 min and im terrified. I cry for my co workers, because we know it will get worse and I already feel like that is impossible and we are already at our breaking point, I cry for the parents, children, siblings, spouses who cannot be with their loved ones who may be dying but cant have visitors because there is no visiting allowed,\" the nurse added. Chicago and Detroit could be next new hot spots Outbreaks in New York, Washington and California have captured the nation's attention for weeks -- but some health officials predict areas of Michigan and Illinois could be the next epicenters of the crisis. Dr. Deborah Birx, the White House's coronavirus response coordinator, said health officials are concerned that counties like Wayne County, Michigan and Cook County, Illinois are showing a \"more rapid increase\" in cases.  Birx noted that 40% of the country has \"extraordinary low rates\" of coronavirus\" About 19 states have fewer than 200 cases, she said. Louisiana, which has seen coronavirus cases climb this week, is already emerging as another hot spot. New Orleans is facing critical shortages of ventilators and protective equipment, an official told CNN Thursday.  \"This is going to be the disaster that defines our generation,\" Collin Arnold,  director of the city's Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness, said. Health officials said they are monitoring six nursing homes in the state, including the 268-resident Lambeth House Retirement Community in New Orleans, where 11 deaths were reported on Tuesday.  Hospitals brace for equipment shortages Numerous hospitals expect to run out of beds within two weeks, as cases continue to rise.   If more beds don't become available, \"then we don't have resources to save the lives that we need to save,\" former Louisiana Secretary of Health Dr. Rebekah Gee said. \"That's why these stay-at-home orders are so important.\" But \"we have not seen the peak of the crisis yet,\" Gee said. US coronavirus deaths could peak in 3 weeks, epidemiologist says Desperate for protective face masks, Gee said health care workers have been punching holes in plastic office report covers and running string through those holes.  \"I think what's just as concerning is the fact that we need more ventilators,\" she said. \"And that is something that the federal government needs to step in and fix.\"  Many have called for President Donald Trump to use the Defense Production Act to speed up the availability of critical health equipment.  This week, Trump and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) gave conflicting information about whether the act was being used.    New York will allow two patients to share a single ventilator In an effort to address the desperate need for medical equipment, New York state has approved technology that allows two patients to share a ventilator. As of Thursday, more than half of US coronavirus cases were in New York state, with more than 37,000, according to CNN's tally of cases reported by state health officials nationwide. Gov. Andrew Cuomo referred to the method as \"splitting\" and said it involves adding a second set of tubes to a ventilator. \"It's not ideal,\" Cuomo said on Thursday, \"but we believe it's workable.\" New York hospitals need about 30,000 ventilators and have enough personal protection equipment for only the next two weeks, the governor has said.  Wednesday, the state had 4,000 ventilators in hospitals and another 4,000 on the way from the federal government. New York has also purchased 7,000 ventilators and is \"still shopping,\" the governor said. The ventilators are the \"difference between life and death for thousands of New Yorkers,\" New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said. In San Francisco, Mayor London Breed said her city could see a surge in cases similar to that seen in New York City. She estimated San Francisco could need as many as 1,500 more ventilators and 5,000 more hospital beds. \"If people who are out on the streets continue to congregate with one another, continue to interact with one another which increases the spread of this virus, we will not have enough beds, enough ICU units, enough ventilators to support the people that we know are going to need them,\" Breed said. 'Dear God, stay home, save lives' Across the country, 21 states have issued stay-at-home orders, with some not going into effect until the end of the week.  Georgia and Florida do not have statewide rules, but Atlanta enacted its own stay-at-home order, and Miami announced a nighttime curfew.  People without symptoms are fueling the spread of coronavirus In Chicago, Mayor Lori Lightfoot announced Thursday that bike trails, paths and green spaces will be closed after crowds were spotted on the city's lakefront. \"Congregating on our lakefront, to be blunt, is going to create a risk that is unacceptable and could lead to death,\" Lightfoot said. \"Dear God, stay home, save lives.\" The decision comes after Interim Chicago Police Superintendent Charlie Beck said police will start issuing citations Thursday to residents who do not follow rules around social distancing and staying at home. Breaking the orders is a misdemeanor punishable by a citation with a fine of up to $500, Beck said. If violation continues, it could result in physical arrest. New York state has restricted nonessential business and gatherings. Residents are asked to limit outdoor activities to non-contact activities.  Civil fines will be issued to non-compliant businesses, but not to individuals, Cuomo said.  In Los Angeles, Mayor Eric Garcetti said the city also will be enforcing restrictions against non-essential businesses that are staying open. But Los Angeles police will not stop people for exercising and leaving their homes, Garcetti said. Record-setting unemployment claims The widespread shutdown of businesses to try to control the outbreak has led to a record number of Americans filing for their first week of unemployment benefits. About 3.3 million Americans filed for initial jobless claims during the week that ended Saturday, according to newly released Department of Labor statistics.  That's the highest number of initial jobless claims since the Department of Labor started tracking the data in 1967. The previous high was 695,000 claims filed in the week ending October 2, 1982. Last week's jump marked a massive increase from a revised 282,000 claims in the prior week.  Some Americans hope a $2 trillion stimulus bill will help, but some analysts say it's not nearly enough.  Outbreak could last 12 to 18 months -- if we're 'lucky' Hopes that the outbreak could subside by summer might not be realistic, a Harvard doctor said Thursday.  \"We are going to be living with this, in one form or another, for 12 to 18 months if we are lucky,\" said Dr. Ashish Jha, director of the Harvard Global Health Institute. That time frame refers to how long health officials predict it will take to make a publicly available vaccine.  \"Once we have a vaccine that's effective and widely deployed, we can bring the pandemic to an end,\" Jha said. \"Until that time, we are going to continue to have to confront and deal with the virus.\" You asked, we answered: Your top coronavirus questions CNN's Jacqueline Howard, Jen Christensen, Anneken Tappe, Brynn Gingras, Omar Jimenez and Sarah Moon contributed to this report. \n","Label: politics , Text: Donald Trump doesn't want to fire Anthony Fauci. He wants him to quit.  (CNN)For a guy best known in pop culture -- prior to 2016 -- for telling people \"You're fired,\" Donald Trump doesn't actually like to fire people.  His preferred method to get people to leave is to make his unhappiness with them very clear -- publicly and privately -- and hope they just sort of, well, go away. Which brings me to the President and his one-time top coronavirus adviser: Dr. Anthony Fauci, the head of the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases.  While the relationship has been strained for months, it took on new awkwardness in the wake of a new Trump campaign ad that seeks to (misleadingly) suggest Fauci was praising the President's response to the Covid-19 pandemic. Fauci asked for the ad to be taken down because it painted him in a political light, which he has studiously avoided throughout his career in service of six sitting presidents.  Trump's campaign refused. And the President went off.  \"Actually, Tony's pitching arm is far more accurate than his prognostications,\" tweeted the President of the United States on Tuesday morning. \"'No problem, no masks'. WHO no longer likes Lockdowns - just came out against. Trump was right. We saved 2,000,000 USA lives!!!\" (Fauci famously/infamously threw out the first pitch of the 2020 season for the Washington Nationals. It did not go well.) Fauci, to his credit, knows exactly what Trump is doing.  \"By doing this against my will they are, in effect, harassing me,\" Fauci told the Daily Beast of the Trump campaign continuing to run the ad featuring his voice. \"Since campaign ads are about getting votes, their harassment of me might have the opposite effect of turning some voters off.\" But Fauci also noted that the President's plan wouldn't work. \"Not in my wildest freakin' dreams did I ever think about quitting,\" he told the Beast. Which sets up a sort of staring contest between the President of the United States and the best-known doctor in the country. Or, more accurately, continues the staring contest. Fauci, who was front and center during the earliest days of the country's fight with coronavirus, has been increasingly sidelined over recent months as he has been unwilling to back up Trump's increasingly erratic claims about treatments, the arc of the virus and the arrival of vaccines. In Fauci's place, people who are more willing to agree with Trump -- Dr. Scott Atlas being one -- have been elevated. But Fauci hasn't gone away. He continues to advocate for known mitigation measures for the virus -- mask-wearing, social distancing, avoiding large groups -- that the President largely dismisses or ignores. (At a Monday rally in Florida in which few attendees wore masks and where social distancing was not closely observed, Trump said this: \"I feel so powerful, I'll walk into that audience. I'll walk in there, I'll kiss everyone in that audience. I'll kiss the guys and the beautiful women and the -- everybody. I'll just give everybody a big, fat kiss.\") Of Trump's Florida rally, Fauci told CNN's Jake Tapper this: \"We know that that is asking for trouble when you do that. We have seen that, when you have situations of congregate settings, where there are a lot of people without masks, the data speak for themselves. It happens.\" What's clear is that Fauci isn't going anywhere voluntarily. And because Trump is Trump, he won't stop bullying Fauci in an attempt to make things so uncomfortable that the doctor bows out. The closest analog for what the future of this fight looks like may well be how Trump treated Attorney General Jeff Sessions following his decision to recuse himself from the FBI's counterintelligence investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. Trump denigrated Sessions every chance he could get, suggesting that the AG had not been sufficiently loyal to him and needed to go. Sessions refused. Trump, his hand forced, eventually fired Sessions on the day after the 2018 midterm elections. Could Fauci suffer the same fate? Sure, but Trump has to win a second term first. And that isn't close to guaranteed.  \n","Label: health , Text: Summer is here, and your mask is sweaty. Here's what to do about it  (CNN)It's hot. You're sweaty. And if you're still coronavirus-conscious, then you're wearing your mask.  Not that the thick humidity of summer makes it any easier.  You may have the impulse to forgo a face mask until the fall. Don't, said Anne Rimoin, professor of epidemiology at UCLA and director of the university's Center for Global and Immigrant Health. \"It's important to wear a mask and maintain social distancing,\" she said, referencing a study published earlier this month that found both strategies are the most effective ways to prevent coronavirus transmission. \"All of these layers are measures of protection.\"  It's especially important to keep doing both of those right now -- at least 19 states have seen surges in coronavirus cases as of late.  So if you have trouble breathing through your mask or the beads of sweat running down your cheeks make it uncomfortable to wear, read on -- you can survive the summer heat and stave off coronavirus.  Why your mask may be making you hotter If you feel suffocated beneath your mask, that's probably because it's trapping heat inside, said Dr. Richard Wenzel, a professor in the Division of Infectious Diseases at the Virginia Commonwealth University School of Medicine. \"A key issue is that when we breathe, we cool off, so wearing a mask that (gets) quickly hot can lead to an elevated temperature in extreme heat, especially if accompanied by humidity,\" Wenzel said.  In other words, if you can't breathe easily through your mask and you're wearing it outside, you could overheat.  If you feel yourself struggling to breathe, take your mask off -- just make sure you can keep at least six feet of distance from others -- sit in the shade and drink some water, Wenzel suggested.  If you feel dizzy or your heart is racing, you need to remove the mask, get out of the heat and seek medical attention, he said -- those could be signs of heat exhaustion.  Wenzel had advice for the thousands of Americans out protesting, too: Continue to wear masks while you navigate crowds, hydrate frequently, and take a break from the heat when you can. It helps to put a cold, wet towel on your face and neck periodically, he said. Avoid extreme heat if possible If your trip outside can wait until it's cooler, it should, Rimoin said. \"If you must go outside, you might want to avoid going out when it's really hot,\" she said.  In extreme heat and humidity, it can be harder to breathe through your mask. Rimoin suggests if you've got to get outside, go first thing in the morning or later in the evening before the heavy heat sticks around. If it can wait, choose to venture out on a day when it's cooler.  Pick a breathable mask material Part of your breathing problems could be due to your mask material. \"How well you can breathe through a material is as important as how well it stops the spread of disease,\" Rimoin said.  Cotton masks are preferred by many for their \"breathability\" and comfort, she said. Masks with cotton outer layers and flannel inner layers also work well.  The ideal cloth face mask should fit \"snugly but comfortably\" against your face, and you should be able to wash and dry it without damaging its shape, she said.  Make sure your mask is on correctly If you're having trouble breathing through your mask, confirm you're wearing it correctly before ditching it entirely.  Your mask should cover your nose and mouth and fit snugly against the sides of your face but loosely on the inside so your breathing isn't obstructed, Rimoin said. If you need to take off the mask, only do so when you're at least six feet away from others, she said.  Bring a spare if it's sweaty A wet mask can stick to your face and obstruct your breathing in a different way. If you find yourself sweating through your mask, bring extras. Wenzel said he suggests subbing in a spare mask you carry in a plastic sandwich bag. There's a better chance it'll stay relatively clean if you carry it that way.  Wear a mask when it's necessary The risk of coronavirus is generally lower outdoors, where wind can blow the virus away and you can (hopefully) maintain distance from others. Pools and beaches are generally safe, too, since water isn't thought to harbor the virus. Just keep your distance from others in and out of the water, since respiratory droplets can still travel when you're outside. It's not practical to wear a mask in the water, but they should still be worn when you get out of it, especially if you can't get the necessary distance between you and others, Rimoin said. If the heat weren't enough, respiratory issues can impede your breathing too. If you have asthma, chronic lung disease or another respiratory illness, be mindful of how your breathing ability changes in the heat, Wenzel said. If it gets worse, stay out of the heat as much as possible.  \n","Label: entertainment , Text: Sen. Tammy Duckworth, who lost her legs serving in Iraq, hits back after Tucker Carlson suggests she hates America New York (CNN)Democratic Sen. Tammy Duckworth, a US Army veteran who lost both of her legs while serving in Iraq, rebuked Tucker Carlson after the conservative Fox News host attacked her on Monday night and suggested that she hates America. \"Does @TuckerCarlson want to walk a mile in my legs and then tell me whether or not I love America?\" Duckworth wrote on Twitter. Duckworth was awarded the Purple Heart after she lost her legs in 2004 when a rocket-propelled grenade hit the helicopter she was co-piloting during the Iraq War. Duckworth later retired from the Illinois Army National Guard as a lieutenant colonel and went on to serve as the assistant secretary of the Department of Veterans Affairs in the Obama administration. When she was elected to the US Senate in 2016, she became the first female double-amputee to serve in the chamber and she was the first senator to give birth while in office. But Carlson, whose controversial comments over the years have prompted multiple advertiser boycotts, sought to question her patriotism on his Fox News program. \"You're not supposed to criticize Tammy Duckworth in any way because she once served in the military,\" Carlson said, acknowledging that he was aware of her service. Carlson then attacked Duckworth as a \"deeply silly\" and \"unimpressive person\" over comments she made on CNN in which she suggested having a \"national dialogue\" over the possible removal of monuments to the founding fathers, such as George Washington, who owned slaves. \"It's long been considered out of bounds to question a person's patriotism,\" Carlson said, after playing the clip from Duckworth's appearance on CNN over the weekend. \"It's a very strong charge and we try not to ever to make it.\" \"But in the face of all this, the conclusion can't be avoided: These people actually hate America,\" Carlson added. \"There's no longer a question about that.\" The attack on Duckworth came as she is being considered as a vice presidential running mate for Joe Biden. People familiar with the matter told CNN in late June that she is among a broader tier under consideration.  \n","Label: entertainment , Text: Jennifer Aniston is here with a friendly reminder to 'wear a damn mask'  (CNN)Jennifer Aniston showed us her mask, now she wants to see yours. On Tuesday, the \"Morning Show\" star took to Instagram with a photo of herself wearing a face mask, alongside a message encouraging everyone to wear a mask amid the coronavirus pandemic.  \"I understand masks are inconvenient and uncomfortable. But don't you feel that it's worse that businesses are shutting down... jobs are being lost... health care workers are hitting absolute exhaustion. And so many lives have been taken by this virus because we aren't doing enough,\" she wrote. She continued: \"I really do believe in the basic goodness of people so I know we can all do this ... BUT still, there are many people in our country refusing to take the necessary steps to flatten the curve, and keep each other safe,\" she continued. \"People seem worried about their 'rights being taken away' by being asked to wear a mask. This simple and effective recommendation is being politicized at the expense of peoples' lives. And it really shouldn't be a debate. If you care about human life, please... just #wearadamnmask and encourage those around you to do the same.\" Aniston included a mask, heart and prayer emoji in her post.  As numerous states have pushed to reopen and restart the economy, there has been a huge increase in the number of Covid-19 cases.   \n","Label: entertainment , Text: 'Driving While Black' ties mobility restrictions of the past directly to the present  (CNN)\"Driving While Black\" has a specific modern meaning. \"Driving While Black: Space, Race and Mobility in America\" turns out to be an extremely rich and detailed PBS documentary, exploring the long history of restrictions on Black movement, from slavery through the present. As part of that journey, the two-hour film addresses not only modern-day issues of policing but deeper ones about the American Dream denied. There is, inevitably, a section devoted to the period covered by the controversial Oscar-winning movie \"Green Book,\" including the fascinating background of New York City mailman Victor Hugo Green, who came up with the idea of a publication telling African-American motorists where they could safely stay and buy gas when traveling in the South. As the film makes clear, it's indicative of the ingenuity and entrepreneurial spirit that grew up around navigating the Jim Crow era. The range encompassed by \"Driving While Black,\" however, is much broader than that, beginning with the way slaves were carefully monitored, as well as the impact of the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850, which allowed slave owners to seek the return of those who escaped to the North, a significant contributor to the tensions that led to the Civil War. The advent of the automobile brought new possibilities, but also highlighted inequality at virtually every turn. While whites \"discovered the joys of the open road,\" as journalist Alvin Hall says -- with advertising jingles like \"See the USA in your Chevrolet\" -- Blacks saw cars as the means to achieving a better life, while using what they drove as a symbol of their status, especially to folks back home when they visited. The introduction of interstate highways, similarly, disproportionately impacted Black neighborhoods, devastating many as their construction was designed to plow through them. Directed by historian Gretchen Sorin and filmmaker Ric Burns, \"Driving While Black\" conveys the fear associated with having to adhere to \"invisible rules\" of where Blacks could go and stay, a dynamic that has evolved into the era of modern policing. As historian Christopher West emotionally observes, the true meaning of the term \"Driving while Black\" is really the same as \"Driving while afraid,\" asking, \"If I have to fear the state ... am I member of this society? Is my son a member of this society?\" \"Driving While Black\" thus becomes an expansive examination of the African-American experience, then and now, with a final portion devoted to policing that not only drives the point home but directly connects the past to the present. \"Americans love to celebrate their history, but they don't like to look at it very closely,\" historian Craig Steven Wilder says. That's a shortcoming that \"Driving While Black,\" for those who take the time to watch it, meticulously works to correct. \"Driving While Black\" premieres Oct. 13 at 9 p.m. on PBS.  \n","Label: health , Text: US may have to endure social distancing until 2022 if no vaccine is quickly found, scientists predict  (CNN)This may be the new normal for quite a while. The US may have to endure social distancing measures -- such as stay-at-home orders and school closures -- until 2022, researchers projected on Tuesday.  That is, unless a vaccine or better therapeutics becomes available, or we increase our critical care capacity. In other words, 2022 is one scenario of many.  That's according to researchers from the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, who published their findings in the journal Science on Tuesday. Those findings directly contradict research being touted by the White House that suggests the pandemic may stop this summer. The team at the Harvard School of Public Health used what's known about Covid-19 and other coronaviruses to create possible scenarios of the current pandemic. \"Intermittent distancing may be required into 2022 unless critical care capacity is increased substantially or a treatment or vaccine becomes available,\" they wrote in their report. \"Even in the event of apparent elimination, SARS-CoV-2 surveillance should be maintained since a resurgence in contagion could be possible as late as 2024.\" The Harvard team's projections also indicate that the virus would come roaring back fairly quickly once restrictions were lifted. \"If intermittent distancing is the approach that's chosen, it may be necessary to do it for several years, which is obviously a very long time,\" Dr. Marc Lipsitch, an author on the study and an epidemiology professor at the Harvard School of Public Health, told reporters. Another important factor: Whether people become immune to the new coronavirus after they have been infected. That's not yet known. Potential challenges include finding a reliable test to determine who has antibodies for the coronavirus, establishing the level of immunity conferred by previous infection and how long it lasts, and the capacity of overstretched health systems to carry out reliable, widespread antibody tests in the general population. There's also the difficult social questions around immunity certificates, which have been floated as a possibility in the UK. Would they create a kind of two-tier society, where those who have them can return to a more normal life, while others remain locked down? The study researchers say they are aware that such prolonged distancing, even if intermittent, would likely have \"profoundly negative economic, social, and educational consequences.\"  They hope their research will help identify likely trajectories of the epidemic under alternative approaches, identify complementary ways to fight it, and to spur further thinking about ways to get the pandemic under control. Though coronavirus cases in the US have been soaring, social distancing appears to be effective.  Social distancing is \"one of the most powerful weapons\" against COVID-19, said Robert Redfield, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  \"If we can just maximize that social distancing, we can limit this virus's ability,\" he said earlier this month.  States across the country have issued stay-at-home orders, allowing only for essential errands or tasks.  Penalties for breaking the order vary by state. In Maine, the penalty for breaking the order can be up to six months in jail and up to a $1,000 fine. In Florida, a pastor was arrested last month for continuing to hold large services and is charged with unlawful assembly and violation of public health emergency rules, both second-degree misdemeanors. This week, states on the East and West coasts announced they are forming their own regional pacts to work together on how to reopen after the stay-at-home orders.  New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Rhode Island and Massachusetts each plan to name a public health and economic official to a regional working group.  West Coast states of California, Washington and Oregon also announced they are joining forces in a plan to begin incremental release of stay-at-home orders. CNN's Steve Almasy, Jason Hanna, Laura Smith-Spark, Maeve Reston, Kristina Sgueglia, Cheri Mossburg and Christina Maxouris contributed to this report. \n","Label: entertainment , Text: Comic-Con is usually a crowded mess. That's all the more reason to miss it  (CNN)There might be no event less conducive to social distancing than Comic-Con, the annual pop-culture gathering that packs 130,000 people into San Diego's convention center. Granted, there are a lot of masks, but many are of the Captain America or Batman variety that covers the wrong part of the face. Having griped about this largest-of-its-kind event in the past -- the long lines, dizzying logistics, cramped crowds, and strange smells associated with all those costumes -- it's hard not to acutely feel its absence. The reasons to complain about Comic-Con are, suddenly, all the reasons to miss it. The decision to cancel Comic-Con -- which organizers called \"heartbreaking\" -- came amid a wave of similar decisions during the early stages of the coronavirus, as the prospect of large gatherings became increasingly untenable. In its place, a virtual version is scheduled to take place over several days beginning July 22 -- in practical terms, sacrificing millions of dollars that Comic-Con pumps into the San Diego economy. Among all the pastimes and pleasures lost, few events more acutely demonstrate the hunger for community, and indeed, the ability to conjure those feelings of connection around entertainment -- from collecting comic books or watching niche web shows to the broadest offerings from cultural titans like Marvel, \"Star Wars\" and \"Star Trek.\" Comic-Con celebrated its 50th anniversary last year, having ballooned from a smallish assembly that occupied a couple of hotel ballrooms in the early 1970s into the massive undertaking that spills out of the convention center into nearby hotels filled by its guests. As the event rapidly grew, Hollywood increasingly took over, recognizing all those avid fans as the ultimate marketing opportunity and eager ambassadors for its products. Enthusiasts once teased for their passions soon found themselves surrounded by newer converts, hanging on every twist in the Marvel Cinematic Universe or clamoring for the \"Snyder cut\" of \"Justice League\" (and winning that concession, finally, from CNN's fellow WarnerMedia property HBO Max). Still, the enthusiasm that permeated the convention offered a lingering connection to its origins, and a sense that many who attended spent all year  anticipating the opportunity to assemble in person with those who shared their infatuations, however obscure and arcane some of them might be. Like most of the virtual events orchestrated in the last several months, Comic-Con is trying to offer a taste of that as a stopgap measure. But it seems more imperfect than most, given how fundamental the immersive aspect of being surrounded by pop culture for several days has always been to the experience. Although a number of popular franchises are participating, movie studios will largely sit out the exercise, as release dates for major films remain in flux. Highlights of the four-day schedule are available on the Comic-Con website. The emphasis on fantasy won't prevent the panels from addressing our current reality, including sessions on whether pop culture can promote mental wellness during the pandemic, and a discussion of what we can learn about dealing with infectious diseases moderated by \"World War Z\" author Max Brooks. As someone who has occasionally approached making that drive down Interstate 5 to San Diego with trepidation if not quite dread, getting back to all that the convention has to offer -- even the lousier parts -- sounds awfully good right now. Until then, Comic-Con@Home will have to do. And hopefully in the near future -- whenever there's an actual convention again -- remembering this time should quiet any grumbling when the impulse to grumble arises.  \n","Label: politics , Text: Ruth Bader Ginsburg's army of clerks to stand guard at the Supreme Court  (CNN)When Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg returns for the final time to the Supreme Court on Wednesday, an army of more than a hundred of her former clerks will meet the casket and accompany it up the stone steps leading to the great hall where the liberal icon presided for almost 30 years.   The Supreme Court, built on precedent and rooted in tradition, will honor Ginsburg in a private ceremony and then a public viewing, but her former clerks, standing guard, won't leave the casket.  When the casket arrives at the court, some of her clerks will serve as honorary pallbearers while the rest will line the building's steps. About 120 clerks from her days at the appellate court as well as the Supreme Court are expected to gather at the court. Besides her family and written opinions, Ginsburg's clerks are her most lasting legacy. They began their tenures as young inexperienced lawyers and emerged with unparalleled legal credentials that will mark their resumes for a lifetime: Supreme Court clerk.  But for many, working for Ginsburg wasn't just a legal lesson. She also instilled the notion that women could have it all, but maybe not at the same time. She praised her \"life partner,\" her husband, Marty, \"the only man,\" she would say, who \"cared that I had a brain.\"  The justice -- who was a night owl, a stickler for administrative law and close friends with her ideological opposite, the late Justice Antonin Scalia -- was a role model in both law and life. \"The justice taught us all a thing or two about a life well lived,\" said former clerk Lori Alvino McGill.  \"She was among the first mentors to tell me I could do anything -- but she also told me that it would be foolish to think I could do many things well at the same time,\" said McGill. \"The life lessons she imparted gave me the courage to take a step back from my own career and choose, for this moment in time, to be more present for my three children.\" Ginsburg told her clerks that sometimes in marriage, and in work, it helps to be \"a little bit deaf,\" and she taught them about perseverance and herculean strength.  Amanda Tyler joined the justice's chambers in the summer of 1999 but soon learned that weeks before the new term was to begin, Ginsburg had received her first cancer diagnosis. Most believed she would sit out arguments to go through an extensive treatment regimen. But on the first day of the term, Tyler -- who wrote about the experience for The Atlantic magazine -- got the call from the justice.   \"Amanda,\" she said, \"call the chief's chambers and make sure he knows I'm coming.\" Later, Ginsburg would show off the new fanny pack she had acquired to hide her portable chemotherapy device.  The day after her husband died in 2010, Ginsburg was on the bench, rarely missing a session.  In the weeks before her own death, she exchanged drafts for a book project she was working on with Tyler.  \"She was still teaching me about the craft of writing -- how important precision is, and to never use four words when three will do,\" Tyler said.  \"With a marriage, new birth or a new job, a note from the justice followed,\" said Lisa Blatt, who clerked for Ginsburg at the US District Court for the District of Columbia. \"And when visiting with the justice, she always asked about our kids and how the job was going.\" Ginsburg was picky about the kind of clerks she chose. \"My very first year on the court, I was served by a law clerk who had been with me on the DC circuit, and his application was tremendously attractive to me. Why? Because he wrote that he was studying law at night at Georgetown and the reason was that his wife, an economist, had a good job at the World Bank,\" she told The National Constitution Center's Jeffrey Rosen in 2018.  The stories are legend. When Ginsburg first heard her nickname -- Notorious RBG -- she wasn't sure what it meant-- so she asked a clerk.  \"I asked my law clerk, what is the Notorious RBG?\" she told an audience at Duke Law school in 2015.  Once she learned that the name was a play on that of the late Notorious B.I.G., a rapper, it became a talking point in the legion of speeches and appearances that she would make even when she was ailing from one of her five bouts of cancer. Often carrying a small canvas tote bag that read \"I dissent,\" she'd tell the audience that she was a lot like her namesake \"because we are both from Brooklyn.\" The crowd would roar.  By the end, the 87-year-old was far hipper than her former clerks. There were \"you can't have the truth without Ruth\" and \"fear the frill\" T-shirts as well as coffee mugs and bobbleheads. One musician set her dissent in a religious liberty case to music.  Right about then, it wasn't just her younger clerks who she was impressing: She had become an icon.  \"It makes absolute sense that Justice Ginsburg has become an idol for younger generations,\" Justice Elena Kagan said at an event at the New York Bar Association in 2014. \"Her impact on America and American law has been extraordinary.\"  \n","Label: politics , Text: Trump's campaign rocked by coronavirus one month before election  (CNN)President Donald Trump's campaign has been thrown into chaos, adjusting its tactics, messaging and work environment following Trump and a number of top aides and political allies' positive tests for coronavirus.  Trump is in the hospital. His campaign manager, Bill Stepien, and the Republican National Committee chairwoman, Ronna McDaniel, contracted the virus. All of the campaign's planned rallies and fundraisers featuring the President and his family are on hold. And Trump's ability to debate Democratic rival Joe Biden again is uncertain.  Trailing Biden with one month left in the 2020 race, Trump is now stuck in a position he's spent months trying to avoid: Faced with an election that is all about the coronavirus pandemic, with no way to change the topic.  With ballots already available in 35 states and voting beginning in the swing states of Arizona, Iowa, New Hampshire and Ohio within the next week, millions of votes could be cast with Trump sick with a virus he has downplayed for months. The next time Trump and Biden are scheduled to meet in person for a debate is October 15, for a town hall-style event in Miami. But it's unclear now whether Trump will be physically able to participate. The Commission on Presidential Debates is already preparing to make a change that is effectively a rebuke of Trump, whose guests declined a Cleveland Clinic doctor's request that they wear masks at the first debate on Tuesday. A source familiar with the matter said the commission will announce that everyone in the debate halls, except the candidates and moderator, must remained masked until conclusion -- and those not wearing masks will be escorted out. Trump's other ways of narrowing Biden's consistent lead in national and swing-state polls are limited: Biden is expected to report a massive fundraising total from September -- one that sources familiar with the matter said will top his record-smashing $365 million August haul. That would likely position Biden as the clear leader in the cash race through November 3, allowing him to out-spend Trump on advertising.  Trump had driven news coverage with his bombastic rallies, some of which were being held indoors and all of which featured crowds which were tightly packed together and largely without masks. But those are on hold, too, Stepien said in a statement Friday. All in-person campaign activities involving Trump and his family have been postponed or are being switched to virtual events, Stepien said. \"We're really back to where we were on the campaign in March and April, where the President was communicating via telephone town hall rallies and talking to people through his social media activities and through the television,\" Corey Lewandowski, who was Trump's first 2016 campaign manager and saw Trump at a Minnesota rally on Wednesday, told Fox News on Friday. \"So it's going to be a different type of campaign.\"  Vice President Mike Pence, who tested negative for the virus Saturday, will be active on the campaign trail. Trump's campaign announced a Thursday rally in Arizona that Pence will headline.  And events with Trump's surrogates were continuing over the weekend. Trump campaign aide Marc Lotter tweeted a photo from an Iowa event with Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds in which the governor and many attendees were not wearing masks. The campaign's approach to voter outreach doesn't appear to have changed yet, with in-person canvassing -- which Trump's allies have done for months, while Biden was set to resume door-knocking this weekend -- going forward.  Stepien told staff he will work from home. Stepien is expected to reach out to campaign staff and grassroots leaders in a series of conference calls on Saturday and Pence is planning to be a part of at least one of them.   Meanwhile, at the campaign's Arlington headquarters, deputy campaign manager Justin Clark, is overseeing day-to-day activities.  In a memo to staff prior to his positive test, Stepien instructed his team work from home if they believe they came in close contact with someone who tested positive for the virus. \"In consultation with the White House Medical Unit and our own medical consultants, any campaign staff member who has had exposure to someone testing positive should immediately begin self-quarantine,\" Stepien wrote, though he also told staff without symptoms that it was unnecessary to self-quarantine. On Saturday, it was clear how badly Trump's campaign was struggling to find a message to meet the new moment it faces.  Trump's campaign frequently seeks to set the tone of coverage of Biden by posing a \"question of the day.\" The question the campaign sent reporters Saturday morning was: \"Do you regret repeatedly attacking President Trump in a Michigan speech on the same day he was diagnosed with COVID-19?\"  The email followed Trump campaign spokesman Tim Murtaugh complaining Friday that Biden had attacked Trump during a speech in Grand Rapids, Michigan.  But the complaints are hollow: Biden was mildly critical of Trump's handling of the economy, noting that -- if he loses on November 3 -- Trump is on track to become the first president in modern history to leave office with an economy with fewer jobs than he entered with. But he did not attack Trump in personal terms, dropping his usual \"Scranton vs. Park Ave.\" message and his usual criticism of Trump's history of racist comments and actions. And his campaign said it has pulled its ads condemning Trump. Trump has not taken any of his attack ads down. And on Friday -- with Biden campaigning in Michigan and Trump about to head to Walter Reed Medical Center -- Trump's campaign in a fundraising email to supporters attacked former President Barack Obama, calling him \"Lyin' Obama,\" and said Biden is \"probably already asleep in his basement.\"  Meanwhile, the Trump campaign's complaints conflict with how Trump himself dealt with an opponent who was sick. At a 2016 rally, Trump mocked Hillary Clinton after her bout with pneumonia.  \"She's supposed to fight all of these different things and she can't make it 15 feet to her car? Give me a break. Give me a break,\" Trump said then. \"Give me a break. She's home resting right now.\"  CNN's Donald Judd, Kaitlan Collins and Dana Bash contributed to this report. \n"],"name":"stdout"}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"PxhqIHteuffp"},"source":["## Questions:"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"nzRTSgwjhwom"},"source":["For this exercise you will use a transformer model **BERT** that was discussed in lecture.

For instance, if your sequence is \"the dog barks\", the attention vector for the word \"bark\" would also emphasize the word \"dog\", as the word \"bark\" has a number of very different meanings. Attention is an way to also pass in sequences in paralell and retain positional significance, whereas a traditional RNN would have to be trained serially, which is very slow, and any given word only has the context of the words that preceed it, which can sometimes negatively affect results."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"J6zhU_TWCW6a"},"source":["#### c) What is the biggest benefit of transformers compared to seqtoseq models?"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"nRBrVqCMCY17"},"source":["The biggest benefit of transformers vs seq2seq models is performance/paralellizibility. A transformer can take in a long sentence and still perform well, whereas the vanishing gradients in a conventional RNN would make that difficult, and training something like a LSTM is very slow.
